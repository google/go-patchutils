 Barnaby The Bear’s my name, never call me Jack or James,
-You will sing my way to fame,
+I will sing my way to fame,
 Barnaby the Bear’s my name.
 Birds taught me to sing,
-Lions taught me,
-Sharks taught me to swim,
 when they took me to their king,
 first I had to fly,
 in the sky so high so high,
 so high so high so high,
+so — if you want to sing this way,
+think of what you’d like to say,
 add a tune and you will see,
 just how easy it can be.
 Treacle pudding, fish and chips,

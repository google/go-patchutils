Children of the sun,
Children of the sun,
see your time has just begun,
searching for your ways,
through adventures every day.
Every day and night,
with the condor in flight,
with all your friends in tow,
you search for the Cities of Gold.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah… wishing for The Cities of Gold.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah… some day we will find The Cities of Gold.
Do-do-do-do ah-ah-ah, do-do-do-do, Cities of Gold.
Do-do-do-do, Cities of Gold. Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah…
some day we will find The Cities of Gold.
some day we will find The Cities of Silver.

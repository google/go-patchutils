When they took me to their king,
first I had to fly,
in the sky so high so high,
so high so high so high.
Barnaby The Bear’s my name, never call me Jack or James, Barbara,
You will sing my way to fame,
Barnaby the Bear’s my name.
Birds taught me to sing,
Lions taught me to roar,
Sharks taught me to swim,
when they took me to their king,
first I had to fly,
in the sky so high so high,
so high so high so high,
add a tune and you will see,
just how easy it can be.
Treacle pudding, fish and chips,
fizzy drinks and liquorice,
snowflakes and the stars are free.
Every day and night,
with the condor in flight,
with all your friends in tow,
you search for the Cities of Gold.

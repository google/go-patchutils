+Barnaby The Bear’s my name, never call me Jack or James,
+I will sing my way to fame,
 Barnaby the Bear’s my name.
 Birds taught me to sing,
-Lions taught me to roar,
-Sharks taught me to swim,

 add a tune and you will see,
 just how easy it can be.
 Treacle pudding, fish and chips,
 fizzy drinks and liquorice,
+flowers, rivers, sand and sea,
 snowflakes and the stars are free.
 Every day and night,
